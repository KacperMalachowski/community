# Dynamic Monitoring Backend Configuration

This folder contains pages for evaluating and proposing a concept for having the monitoring backends (and general telemetry backends) in a Kyma cluster configurable. It mainly tries to propose a concept for [Configurable monitoring #13079](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/issues/13079).

For that, the following pages guide you through the different steps of the proposal:
* [Ground work - current state, requirements, goal](./01-groundwork.md)
* [Agent Technology Selection](./02-agents.md)
* [Different PoC's](./03-pocs.md)
* [API design](./04-api.md)
* [Final Concept](./05-concept.md)
